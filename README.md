# DineSafe: Intelligent Restaurant Management with Fire Evacuation Integration

DineSafe is an innovative restaurant management system developed as part of the MSc Computer Science program. This project seamlessly integrates an intelligent mobile app with ESP32 devices for fire detection and evacuation. The system is designed to enhance restaurant operations, providing role-based features for waiters, chefs, and administrators, while prioritizing customer safety during emergencies.

## Features
- **Cloud Integration:** Utilizes Google Firebase for real-time data synchronization and secure login features.
- **Role-Based Mobile App:** Implements waiter/staff, chef, and admin roles with tailored features for each role.
- **Order Management:** Streamlines order-taking, table assignments, and issue reporting for waiters.
- **Chef Dashboard:** Enables chefs to manage orders, mark readiness, and view order modifications.
- **Admin Analytics:** Provides analytics on daily profits, monitors customer-reported issues, and tracks attendance.
- **Fire Detection System:** Integrates ESP32 devices with smoke and flame detectors for real-time alerts and tailored evacuation plans.

## Objectives
1. **Cloud Database and Firebase Integration:** Research and implement real-time data synchronization.
2. **Unified Mobile App Development:** Implement role-based segregation and design features for each role.
3. **Actors and Their Features:** Defined features for waiters, chefs, and administrators.
4. **Fire Detection System:** Research, select, and integrate suitable ESP32-compatible fire detection modules.

## Legal, Social, and Ethical Considerations
- Adherence to data protection laws.
- Ethical guidelines in app development and fire evacuation alerts.

## Resources
- **Hardware:** Mobile devices both android and IoS, ESP32 devices, testing equipment.
- **Software:** VsCode, Android Studio, Arduino IDE, PHP server, Google Firebase.
- **Human Resources:** Supervisor, faculty members, potential collaboration with restaurant owners.
